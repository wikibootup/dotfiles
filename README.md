üôå This repo is a guide repo for setting up my initial laptop development environment.

1. üçé I am a Mac OS X user, and I install the initial required packages using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) including `brew cask` commands. For more details, you can read [mac/README.md](https://github.com/wikibootup/dotfiles/blob/master/mac/README.md)
2. üß∞ I use iTerm as a terminal, Zsh as a shell, Neovim as a text editor, and Tmux as a screen multiplexer, editor as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with some customization.
3. ü§ñ I have partially automated processes ‚Äú1‚Äù and ‚Äú2‚Äù in the [dotfiles](https://github.com/wikibootup/dotfiles) repo.

The basic settings of Code Editor are as follows.
- Text editor mode is Vim
- The theme is [Drakula](https://draculatheme.com/)
- Code editor is VS Code. [Here](https://github.com/wikibootup/dotfiles/blob/master/vscode/README.md) is the doc for my custom configurations
